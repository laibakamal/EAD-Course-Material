web services/ rational services

abhii tak jo kaam kia hai, us me frontend or backend ek hi jaga thy.
lekin hum frontend kisi bhi tehcnology (react, web app, mobile app etc.) me rkh skty hein, backend NOde.js(C#) me hi ho chahy


Service oriented architecture is used for this purpose. 


RestFul services or rest services:- (to define a service)
1) URL
2) method (HTTP method such as get, post, put, delete)

frontend ko sirf data chahiye is case me tou yahan hamara controller(service) view ki bjaye sirf data return kry ga.


request--> URL + method
response --> data (JSON format)



create VS project (ASP.net core web API)



jese MVC me controller k ander repo k functions call kiye thy, aisy hi API controller me krny hein, bas yaha controller type diff hai


swagger provides you frontend to send request to endpoint of API



localhost: ..... /api/student/abc

Methods:-
